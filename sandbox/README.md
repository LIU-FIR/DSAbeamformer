## Welcome to the Sandbox
This folder contains bits and pieces of code which were used to prototype and explore potential optimizations
and implementations before they entered the main body of code. For the main part, these
files can be ignored, but there are some useful files in here as well.
What follows is a brief description of each file and what they were designed for.

### Beamformer Theory.ipynb
By far and away the most useful file here. Is primary purpose is as a reference implementation
for the beamformer. Contains some ploting functionality for comparing the two implementations.

### Quantization Exploration.ipynb
An exploration of the distribution and extent of quantization error when calculating the
coefficients for the Fourier matrix.
